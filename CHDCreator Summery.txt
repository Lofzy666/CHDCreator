Summary
CHD Creator is a Windows Forms application that batch-converts disc image files to CHD (Compressed Hunted Drive) format, commonly used for retro gaming emulation.

Key Features:

File Discovery: Searches for compressed archives (.7z, .zip) and disc images (.cue, .iso) in selected directories with optional recursive search
Archive Extraction: Automatically extracts archives using 7z before processing
Format Conversion: Converts .cue and .iso files to .chd format using the chdman tool
Flexible Processing: Options to process compressed archives, direct disc image files, or both
Cleanup Control: Can optionally keep or delete original archives and extracted files after conversion
Progress Tracking: Shows real-time conversion progress via progress bar and detailed logging
Log Output: Displays operation logs in-app with optional file-based logging to conversion.log
Embedded Tools: Bundles 7z.exe and chdman.exe as embedded resources
The app essentially automates the workflow of extracting compressed game disc images and converting them to CHD format, useful for organizing large collections of retro games.
